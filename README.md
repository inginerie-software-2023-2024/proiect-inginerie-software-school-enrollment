<h1>School Enrollment System</h1>

<h2>Problem Statement & Product Vision</h2>
Several parents and general schools have complained about the complex enrollment process of the students. So, to solve this problem, we have come with an <b>amazing</b> idea. Why not make it automated and save lots of time for both sides? There is an obvious need for a web platform where parents can register their children and the school principals can either accept or decline their applications. The main users that will interact with the application will be <i>Parents</i>, <i>Principals</i> and <i>Teachers</i>. <br><br>
Parents can apply to multiple schools during a set period of time, Principals can see the applications to their school and accept/decline applications and Teachers can see a list of students they are responsible for.

<!-- <h2>Product features & functionalities</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Parents (regular users) need to register in the app in order to apply to schools.</li>
    <li>Principals register as regular users and then are given that role by a super admin.</li>
    <li>Teachers register as regular users and then are invited by school principals to get the teacher role.</li>
    <li>Each registered parent can complete an application form during the application period.</li>
    <li>Each registered parent and school principal will be notified via email at the beginning of each application period.</li>
    <li>Each registered parent needs to apply to at least one school so that their child/children has/have the possibility to be selected.</li>
    <li>At the end of the application period, all the parents whose children were not accepted (or parents that have not applied to any school for their child/children) can see a list of schools with vacant spots.</li>
    <li>Principals can accept/decline applications during the application period and a week after that.</li>
    <li>After the entire enrollment process ends, teachers can see the list of students they are responsible for.</li>
</ul> -->
