<h1>School Enrollment System</h1>

<h2>Short description</h2>
This is a software project created by a team of 5 students for the Software Engineering course at the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science (University of Bucharest). The project was made using some of the most popular technologies in the industry, namely <b>Java + SpringBoot</b> on the backend with <b>React</b> on the frontend.

<h2>Problem Statement & Product Vision</h2>
Several parents and general schools have complained about the complex enrollment process of the students. So, to solve this problem, we have come with an <b>amazing</b> idea. Why not make it automated and save lots of time for both sides? There is an obvious need for a web platform where parents can register their children and the school principals can either accept or decline their applications. The main users that will interact with the application will be <i>Parents</i>, <i>Principals</i> and <i>Teachers</i>. <br><br>
Parents can apply to multiple schools during a set period of time, Principals can see the applications to their school and accept/decline applications and Teachers can see a list of students they are responsible for.

<h2>Demo Video</h2>
A demo video which displays the main functionalities of the application can be accessed <a href="https://youtu.be/Wpe2jZDHt8Q">here</a>.
<!-- <h2>Product features & functionalities</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Parents (regular users) need to register in the app in order to apply to schools.</li>
    <li>Principals register as regular users and then are given that role by a super admin.</li>
    <li>Teachers register as regular users and then are invited by school principals to get the teacher role.</li>
    <li>Each registered parent can complete an application form during the application period.</li>
    <li>Each registered parent and school principal will be notified via email at the beginning of each application period.</li>
    <li>Each registered parent needs to apply to at least one school so that their child/children has/have the possibility to be selected.</li>
    <li>At the end of the application period, all the parents whose children were not accepted (or parents that have not applied to any school for their child/children) can see a list of schools with vacant spots.</li>
    <li>Principals can accept/decline applications during the application period and a week after that.</li>
    <li>After the entire enrollment process ends, teachers can see the list of students they are responsible for.</li>
</ul> -->
